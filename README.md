# Coffee House Proj
The Coffee House Project was a notable scholastic undertaking in which the objective was to construct a sophisticated and visually appealing website for a coffee house situated in Madison, WI. The prescribed theme was to be in a brown hue, evoking earthy undertones.

This project exemplified the fusion of compliance with guidelines and creative expression. While adhering to the specified requirements, I was able to inject my own imaginative flourishes, rendering the website distinct and personal.

Notably, the website boasted exceptional aptitude in HTML forms, whereby I was tasked with the creation of expansive forms featuring a diversity of buttons, dropdowns, and text areas.

Evidently, the website was an unqualified triumph, as evinced by the positive grading it garnered. However, the true value of this endeavor lies in the development of my skills as a web developer, cementing my growth in this field.
