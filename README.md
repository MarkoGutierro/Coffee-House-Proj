# Coffee House Proj
The Coffee House Project was a school project in which the objective was to construct an engaging and visually appealing website for a coffee house situated in Madison, WI. The theme was to be in a brown hue, evoking earthy undertones.

This project exemplifies my ability to comply with guidelines while still exhibiting my creativity. While adhering to the specified requirements, I was able to introduce my own ideas, rendering the website distinct and personal.

One notable part of the development process was the creation of multiple HTML forms. I was tasked with developing various forms featuring a diversity of different form elements, such as buttons, dropdowns, and text areas.

Overall, this was a fun project to work on. I received a high mark, which was nice as well. I am happy with the increased proficiency in web design and development that this project helped me garner.
