            <h2>Americano</h2>
            <img src="images/americano.png" alt="Americano Cofee picture">
            <p>A single shot of espresso added to a cup of hot water. Many like to drink this as they would a regular
                brewed coffee with milk and sugar. Purists say to keep milk to a minimum to get the most flavor from the
                espresso.</p>

        <article id="caffeLatte">
            <h2>Caffe Latte</h2>
            <img src="images/caffeLatte.png" alt="Caffe Latte Picture">
            <p> A cafe latte, or “latte” for short, is an espresso-based drink with steamed milk and micro-foam added to
                the coffee. This coffee is much sweeter compared to espresso due to the steamed milk.</p>

        <article id="caffeMocha">
            <h2>Caffe Mocha</h2>
            <img src="images/caffeMocha.png" alt="Caffe Mocha Picture">
            <p>A mocha is a mix between a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. It is made by putting mixing chocolate powder
                with an espresso shot and then adding steamed milk and micro-foam into the beverage.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="cappuccino">
            <h2>Cappuccino</h2>
            <img src="images/cappuccino.png" alt="Cappucciono picture">
            <p>A cappuccino is like a latte. However, the key difference between a latte and cappuccino is that a
                cappuccino has more foam and chocolate placed on top of the drink. Further, a cappuccino is made in a
                cup rather than a tumbler glass.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="espresso">
            <h2>Espresso</h2>
            <img src="images/espresso.png" alt="Espresso picture">
            <p>A strong, concentrated coffee made by forcing pressurized water through finely ground coffee beans.
                Served in a small cup called a demitasse, and meant to be taken quickly, like a shot.

        <article id="espressoConPanna">
            <h2>Espresso con panna</h2>
            <img src="images/espressoConPanna.png" alt="Espresso con panna picture">
            <p>Espresso con panna, which means "espresso with cream" in Italian, is a single or double shot of
                espresso topped with whipped cream.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="flatWhite">
            <h2>Flat White</h2>
            <img src="images/flatWhite.png" alt="Flat white picture">
            <p>Flat white is a coffee that is popular in Australia and New Zealand. It is made the same as a cappuccino
                expect it does not have any foam or chocolate on top.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="macchiato">
            <h2>Macchiato</h2>
            <img src="images/macchiato.png" alt="Macchiato picture">
            <p> Espresso with either steamed milk or foamed milk, and flavoring. The most common combination is the
                caramel macchiato–espresso, vanilla, steamed milk, drizzled with caramel.</p>
